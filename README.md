# Web Element Composition Library Example

This is a simple task tracker showcasing how WECU works.

To get it running use the following commands:

1. `yarn` to install the packages.
2. `yarn webpack` to start the webpack and TS compiler.
3. In a seprate console `yarn http-server` to start a HTTP server.
4. Visit the link provided by http-server.

This is by no means a perfect app or even pretty one, but it is designed to showcase some of the functionality of WECU.
